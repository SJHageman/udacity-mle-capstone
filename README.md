## Datasets and Inputs
The data that will be used for this project is from Kaggle, and this is the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robinreni/signature-verification-dataset).  It consists of genuine and forged signatures from Dutch people.  The data comes from ICDAR 2011 SIgnature Verification Comeptition, [linked here](http://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php/ICDAR_2011_Signature_Verification_Competition_(SigComp2011)).
